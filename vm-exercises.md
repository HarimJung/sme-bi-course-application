# Virtual Machine (VM) Exercises

## :information_source: Read this before getting started
- The two exercises should not replicate the exact actions shown in your screencast. The goal of exercises is for learners to apply what was learned in the screencasts to new problems or situations. This is best pedagogical practice for retaining and building skills. For example, this can be done by using another dataset between screencasts and exercises or focusing on a different portion of the dataset.
- We can only run free versions of BI software in our virtual machine exercises. In the case of Power BI, make sure the exercises can run on [Power BI Desktop](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/en-us/desktop/) without any additional paid products. 
- Unsure what the scope of an exercise should be? Here's an [example](https://campus.datacamp.com/courses/introduction-to-power-bi/getting-started-with-power-bi?ex=14) from Introduction to Power BI. The first chapter of most DataCamp courses are free, so take a look at our [BI courses](https://learn.datacamp.com/courses?technologies=Tableau&technologies=Power%20BI) to get a feel for how we assess and guide learners.

## 1st VM Exercise

#### Learning Objective

* Using FIXED LOD per each dimension of "HDI", "Region" and "Income"
* Applying Measure Values and Measure Name to draw charts
* Developing advanced parameter to switch the Measure Values 
* Using True False LOD to set the Shapes in the chart


#### Context

*Following the Chapter 1 practices files with 5 charts applications, users and students can learn to cover the FIXED LOD in various situation to use with parameter options to draw multiple interactive charts and dashboard actions per measures and dimensions. These practices allow students to expand the capacity of chart development beyond measure and dimension in general* 

#### Steps to be executed by the student

*Chapter 1.1-3

- Using a Parameter to "SWITCH" the measures. (ex. SWITCH Measure, make another one using your own parameter)
- Using "Year TF" to specify the year wish Shape (ex. Diamond)
- Using various types of the line graph
- Develop your own LOD to show only year speficied countryname displaying logic

*Chapter 1.5

- Using measure switchable parameter to show measure value in the text
- Using Countryname selecting parameter to choose your country
- UMeasure/1000 value displaying


#### Exercise question:
*How to display both AVERAGE Values with selected country's value of two different measures using Measure parameters? *

#### End goal:

*Add an image of the final visualization here.*


## 2nd VM Exercise

#### Learning Objective

* Devloping the Radius calculated charts with X and Y positioning
* Transform the radial bar chart per preference
* Adding the Radial chart layers per preference

#### Context

*Following Chapter2, students can learn how to develop the advanced LOD using SIN, COS, and RADIANS functions to put calculated X and Y positions using their datasets. Also, practice courses let the students level up the Voronoi chart using with D3 template to manipulate the dataset into an art space chart to apply in a tableau as well.*

#### Steps to be executed by the student 

*Chapter 2

- Radius Position
- Circle Radius
- Angle using 330 degree
- X and Y 
- Drag X and Y and set them as Dimension

#### Exercise question:
*If the client wants to apply more years in the chart to show sequential dataset flow from 1990 to 2020, how to apply this requirement in the chart and LOD. and also, if the client wants to reduce the size of the inner circle, how to solve the request using the LOD with practices?  *

#### End goal:

*Add an image of the final visualization here.*
